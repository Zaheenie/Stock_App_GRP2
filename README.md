Project Scope: The purpose of the Stock Price Application is to have daily updated data and to parse through it in a convenient and easy-to-use application for users trying to buy, check and compare prices. Features will include searching through prices and company names, comparing stock prices, viewing price history, and graphs using stock prices all in a friendly, easy to use graphical interface.


Features:
-Stock Prices Search
As a Day Trader, I want to search stock prices so that I can determine who to buy and sell to.

-Stock Names Search
As a Day Trader, I want to search stock based by name so that I may see if a certain company is still a favorable option.

-Friendly user interface GUI
As a Position Holder, I want to easily traverse through the application so that I can see stock prices on a daily basis to buy stocks for the long term.

-Various Comparisons between multiple stocks
As an Average Citizen, I want to compare stock prices so that I can determine if it is the right one for me personally.

-Price History of selected stocks
As an Account Executive, I want to see the history of stock prices for companies so that I can relate them to my clients.  

-Graph analysis
As a Global Account Manager, I want to be able to see stock prices with a visual aid so that I may show them to company managers and customers.
